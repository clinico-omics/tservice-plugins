(defn- convertor
  "Common convertor dispather.
   Bug fixes: sh is implemented using Clojure futures.  See examples for 'future'
   for discussion of an undesirable 1-minute wait that can occur before
   your standalone Clojure program exits if you do not use shutdown-agents.
   More details: https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.java.shell/sh#example-542692d6c026201cdc3270e7

   Fix Bug: 
     MUST NOT use shutdown-agents, it will cause the problem which the FutureTask was not completed but agent is down.'
